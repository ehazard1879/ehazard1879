- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehazard1879 an anthropologist fluent in historian and cross-cultural natural language processing challenges because my doctorate and professional career incorporated advanced analytical and research methods---ICTS past, present, and future.
- 👀 I’m interested in computational social science and humanities research projects focused on visualizing interactive, dynamic networks over time and across space AND digital civics applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an interactive web map, character animation using Blender, and learning R and Python well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with computing architecture engineers and designers interested in developing interactive tools and products inclusively designed for social impact.
