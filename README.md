- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehazard1879 an anthropologist fluent in historian and cross-cultural natural language processing challenges because my doctorate and professional career incorporated advanced analytical and digital research methods---ICTS past, present, and future.
- 👀 I’m interested in HPC research modeling, computational social science and humanities research projects that visualize interactive, dynamic networks over time and across space AND all forms and interpretations of digital civics.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an interactive web map, character animation using Blender, and learning R and Python well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with computing architecture engineers and designers interested in developing interactive tools and products inclusively designed for social impact.
- 📫 Reach me through GitHub inbox notifications or @globalhomegirl on twitter.
