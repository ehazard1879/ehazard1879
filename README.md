- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehazard1879 a social cultural anthropologist fluent in historian and cross-cultural natural language processing challenges. 
- 👀 I’m interested in computational social science and humanities research projects focused on the digital representation of dynamic networks over time and across multiple units of space. I WILL solve human, policy, and transdiciplinary problems that end or ameliorate disparities of access or knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and javascript with the intention of building interactive information and datavisualization tools that incorporate 19th century African Latin American historical and cultural content.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with computing architecture engineers and designers interested in developing interactive products for educational or general audiences and activists or scholars working on environmental health and wellness topics in sustainable agriculture.
